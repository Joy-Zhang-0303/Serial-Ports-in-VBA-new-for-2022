# Non-Debug Version
This is the 'lightweight' verion of SERIAL_PORTS_VBA with all debug and show functionality removed.

All Main VBA port functions remain functionally equivalent. 

Port debug function remains for compatibility and always returns false.

Suggestion is to use full debug version initially for testing, and then change to this version for regular use if appropriate.
